# react-typescript-clean-template

- React/Typescript clean project template for you to use as a starter project. Extraneous junks that come with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) are removed.
- CSS reset applied (margin and padding are set to zero).

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
- You must be on [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) latest LTS version.

## How to use template
 
Run the command below to create a new project and replace `your-project-name` with your actual project name:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quangnguyen17/react-typescript-clean-template.git your-project-name
```

#### To install project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

```
